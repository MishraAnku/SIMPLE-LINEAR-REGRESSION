# SIMPLE-LINEAR-REGRESSION

1. BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
The business objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using the housing dataset to estimate the median house value based on various attributes such as location, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, and ocean proximity.

2. PROJECT EXPLANATION:
The project involves analyzing the provided housing dataset to gain insights into the factors affecting median house values. This includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The ultimate goal is to build a reliable predictive model that can assist in estimating house values based on given attributes.

3. CHALLENGES:
- Dealing with missing values and outliers in the dataset.
- Selecting appropriate features and handling categorical variables like ocean proximity.
- Ensuring the model's accuracy and generalization capability.
- Addressing potential biases or skewed distributions in the data.
- Managing computational resources, especially for large datasets.

4. CHALLENGES OVERCOME:
- Utilizing techniques like imputation and outlier detection for handling missing values and outliers.
- Employing feature encoding methods for categorical variables, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Employing cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and generalization.
- Employing techniques like stratified sampling to address biases in the dataset.
- Utilizing parallel processing or distributed computing frameworks for efficient computation with large datasets.

5. AIM:
The aim of this project is to develop a reliable predictive model that accurately estimates the median house value based on various attributes, which can be beneficial for real estate professionals, homeowners, and policymakers.

6. PURPOSE:
The purpose of this project is to provide insights into the housing market dynamics and facilitate informed decision-making regarding property investments, pricing strategies, and urban planning initiatives.

7. ADVANTAGE:
